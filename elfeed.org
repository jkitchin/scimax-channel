#+title: Elfeed - RSS Reader in Emacs

What is RSS and why do we still need it in 2021? [[./screenshots/date-07-10-2021-time-13-54-23.png]]

- I think of it as a way to get a summary of things that 
  - I might want to read
  - from many sources
  - in one place
  - that is easy to review
  - and easy to do things with each entry
    - Visit full source
    - add bibtex entry
    - email to someone
    - capture notes
    - etc...
