With org-ref you have a lot of options for processing citations:

1. LaTeX is the single best, most powerful processor when your output is a PDF.

2. CSL is pretty good for non-PDF outputs, e.g. HTML, plain text, and ODF. You do have to find an appropriate CSL style, and install the citeproc library.

An alternative to CSL is the bbl preprocessor in org-ref. This does not require you to have citeproc installed, and leverages the bbl file made from bibtex. Formatting is done with latex_header lines like you would for LaTeX.

3. org-ref provides a natbib-based pre-processor that leverages LaTeX for citation processing to other formats.
