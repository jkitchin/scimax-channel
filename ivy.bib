  abstract =	 {SchNetPack is a toolbox for the development and application of
                  deep neural networks to the prediction of potential energy
                  surfaces and other quantum-chemical properties of molecules
                  and materials. It contains basic building blocks of atomistic
                  neural networks, manages their training and provides simple
                  access to common benchmark datasets. This allows for an easy
                  implementation and evaluation of new models. For now,
                  SchNetPack includes implementations of (weighted) atomcentered
                  symmetry functions and the deep tensor neural network SchNet
                  as well as ready-to-use scripts that allow to train these
                  models on molecule and material datasets. Based upon the
                  PyTorch deep learning framework, SchNetPack allows to
                  efficiently apply the neural networks to large datasets with
                  millions of reference calculations as well as parallelize the
                  model across multiple GPUs. Finally, SchNetPack provides an
                  interface to the Atomic Simulation Environment in order to
                  make trained models easily accessible to researchers that are
                  not yet familiar with neural networks.},
