A hill I will probably die on is that citations belong in the sentence they are used in, i.e. on the left hand side of punctuation. For superscripted citations, though, I agree that they look better on the right side, and that it is not ambiguous in that case what the belong to. 

It is convenient to be able to move citations to the right place when you need to, e.g. at publication time. In LaTeX there is a natmove package that does this for you so you can put the citations in the sentence while writing, but move them when building the PDF.

org-ref now supports this in export via a new preprocessing function.

Cross-references in LaTeX are awesome. You can reference names, pages, and with autoref/cleveref even automatically insert prefix text like Figure or Table, including plurality, with mixed types.

org-ref now provides this kind of support for non-LaTeX exports! This works with a preprocessing hook that replaces the links with org-syntax including the prefix text.
